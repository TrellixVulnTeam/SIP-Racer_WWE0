 A project to test a new type of training for ML 


This is a Unity project used to test whether you could increase the speed machine learnign training by sub-dividing the environment into less complicated versions, training smaller "Sub Models" using these environments, and finally training a "Modal model" which would decide which sub model took action during each step. 

This project is open source, please feel free to reference it and copy anything you need.

This project also used the following two tutorials for reference on setting up and running ML agents, and I recommend them to anyone getting started:
